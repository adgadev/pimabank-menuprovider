######################### NAMED REGEXP GROUPS #######################
# Group names must not contain chars other than letters and digits !
#
# There are three types of named groups : 
#   - LOOP (with suffix LOOPx) - many repetitions of some block of data, i.e. list of menu positions
# 		LOOP named group must contain exactly one BLOCK named group and none NORMAL group (i.e ABCLOOP2 must contain ABCBLOCK3)
#   - BLOCK (with suffix BLOCKx) - one block of data, i.e. one menu position, containing data about id, name, price
#        BLOCK named group may contain multiple NORMAL / LOOP named groups (i.e. ABCBLOCK3 may contain, PRICE4, NAME4, SUBITEMLOOP4)
#   - NORMAL - single data, i.e price
#
# ROOT0 is entry point and behave as BLOCK named group 

# whole line with meal name
CATEGORY1 = (?<CATEGORY1>${TAG_TEXT_LINE})

# a number and a dot (they may be in separate lines)
ID3 = ((?<ID3>^\\d+)$?\\.?$)

# whole line with meal name
NAME3 = (?<NAME3>${TAG_TEXT_LINE})

# whole line with meal name
DESC3 = (?<DESC3>${TAG_TEXT})

# price of meal
PRICE3 = (?<PRICE3>${TAG_PRICE})

# menu position
ITEMBLOCK2 = (?<ITEMBLOCK2>${TAG_ANY_STRING}${ID3}${TAG_ANY_STRING}${NAME3}${TAG_ANY_STRING}${DESC3}${TAG_ANY_STRING}${PRICE3})

ITEMLOOP1 = (?<ITEMLOOP1>${ITEMBLOCK2}*)

# Main regular expression
ROOT0 = ${TAG_ANY_STRING}${CATEGORY1}${TAG_ANY_STRING}${ITEMLOOP1}${TAG_ANY_STRING};
